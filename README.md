# Control system design project - The Centrifugal Ring Positioner



In our control system design lab, we’ve conducted an in-depth analysis and control study of a specific system: 
a mobile hollow cylinder that moves along a shaft driven by a DC motor. Our objective is to use centrifugal force to precisely control 
the ring’s position along the shaft. The system comprises two key components: the ring and the motor. We’ve closely examined each part,
identifying areas for improvement and determining their respective transfer functions. With this information, we’ve created Simulink models for both components. 
After validating these models against the real system, we developed a primary control for the motor and a secondary control for the ring.
